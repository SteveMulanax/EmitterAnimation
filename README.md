#### A fork of of this code is now included in BiblioPixel

That's over here:
https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixelAnimations/tree/master/BiblioPixelAnimations/strip/Emitter

*You can still use the remainder of this document and the code I have here as an add on to previous installations, or you can just follow the README in the directory above after installing a recent version of BiblioPixel.*

#### Setting up the animation with the code in this repository

Install BiblioPixel and clone the files from this repository to a local directory.

#### Running the demo animation

Launch the demo in BibioPixel with simpixel on the local machine:

```bash
bp -s simpixel_star45.yml + emitter_demo.yml
```

If you are using Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi, you may want to set your default browser to Chromium to get WebGL support

```bash
export BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
```
