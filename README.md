#### Setting up the animation

Install BiblioPixel and clone the files from this repository to a local directory.

#### Running the demo animation

Launch the demo in BibioPixel with simpixel on the local machine:

```bash
bp -s simpixel_star45.yml + emitter_demo.yml
```

If you are using Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi, you may want to set your default browser to Chromium to get WebGL support

```bash
export BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
```
