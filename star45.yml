# This is a  BiblioPixel project "header" that describes the 45-pixel
# strip layout that I've assembled into a star shape. It uses the 
# serial driver for Manaical Labs' AllPixelMini board that I'm using.
#
# If your layout is different, you'll need to change this file.
#
# I'm using the 3-wire BTF-5V-30L-B RGB pixel strips from BTF-LIGHTING.
# These have WS2812B pixels every 33.3mm. The LED ordering is GRB.
#
# I made these 3D printable "Star Strips" to support the pixel strips:

# I've got a demo for this setup on YouTube:
